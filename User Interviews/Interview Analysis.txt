üéØ Summary: What the Users Said & Felt
Prototype Context: Users are exploring an installation where colored blocks display quotes. The color of each quote is linked to inferred gender or sentiment. Some quotes are from Disney/Pixar characters, and color is used as a communication or analytical layer (e.g., blue = male, pink = female, light shades = mismatches).

üîç Main Insights with Supporting Quotes
1. Lack of Initial Clarity Confuses Users
Participants struggled to make sense of the installation without clear onboarding or guidance. Many mentioned feeling "lost" or unsure of what the experience was trying to convey.

"I don't know, I'm really lost‚Ä¶ it's kind of random‚Ä¶ the text is so glitchy that it's hard to read." ‚Äî User 1‚Äãuser_1_m4a

"I'm assuming it's mapping my location... but I don't know what the messages are." ‚Äî User 3‚Äãuser_3_m4a

2. Color-Coding Sparks Curiosity but Lacks Intuitive Meaning
Users noticed color-coding (e.g., pink vs. blue), but struggled to understand its exact role without explanation. Some inferred gender or emotional tone, but inconsistently.

"The pink seems more heartfelt and the blue just seems... a little sadder I guess." ‚Äî User 2‚Äãuser_2_m4a

"Maybe the blues for like movies that are about water, pink about maybe princess movies." ‚Äî User 1‚Äãuser_1_m4a

3. Quotes Need to Be More Recognizable for Context
Several participants suggested using more iconic or well-known quotes to help anchor meaning and improve recognizability.

"I love Disney, but the quotes are not recognizable at all. I'd say use more popular quotes." ‚Äî User 1‚Äãuser_1_m4a

"Maybe if there were quotes that are more recognizable‚Ä¶ Dory had like a song that's more recognizable than this quote." ‚Äî User 1‚Äãuser_1_m4a

4. Gender & Character Inference Is Interesting‚ÄîOnce Explained
Once the gender-color logic was explained (male vs. male, and mismatch), users found it more engaging and intellectually stimulating.

"So it's a commentary on the effect the language has‚Ä¶ on how we or AI think who might say something." ‚Äî Facilitator explaining to User 1‚Äãuser_1_m4a

"So these are all like Buzz/Woody male quotes and this is a quote from Dory‚Ä¶ the light colors, are those children?" ‚Äî User 3‚Äãuser_3_m4a

5. Physical Interaction & Camera Detection Was Buggy or Unclear
Users sometimes questioned how movement was being tracked or how spatial layout affected quote appearance. One participant noted technical limitations.

"Unless you walk one time and the camera detected you first‚Ä¶ that guy is not going to get detected." ‚Äî User 1 (facilitator)‚Äãuser_1_m4a

"It's based on where I am?" ‚Äî User 2‚Äãuser_2_m4a

üß≠ Opportunities
Add an Intro or Prompt: Consider using a short onboarding sentence or visual cue to guide interpretation.

Legend for Colors: Even a subtle "color legend" could help users decode the gender/emotion logic more easily.

Quote Familiarity: Swap in more iconic, recognizable lines to increase immediate connection.

Fix Detection Feedback: Show a visual indicator that someone has been "detected" and their presence has triggered the quote.
